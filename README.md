Color Scheme Generator 

The "Color Scheme Generator" is a web application developed as a solo project during my course on the Scrimba platform. Inspired by a design in Figma, this project serves as a practical application of the concepts learned throughout the course.
The "Color Scheme Generator" empowers users to create harmonious color schemes for their projects effortlessly. 
Users begin by selecting a base color using the color picker tool. Once a base color is chosen, the generator dynamically generates five additional colors based on various color scheme options.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized to implement the functionality and design.
Concepts learned during the course, including DOM manipulation and event handling, were applied to create an interactive user experience.
Media queries were employed to ensure optimal display across various devices.
